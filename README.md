Video-player is a web application built by using the React framework and it uses YouTube Data API v3.

You can get a list of videos based on the keyword you put on the search bar. You can click on any of the listed videos to play.

This little project is my effort to undrstand the basics of react and how it works.

Your suggestions are most welcome.


Thank you and have a good day!
